# Bob's Woodworking UI - Cursor Rules

## Architecture Enforcement

### Presenter/Container Pattern
- Presenters (presenters/): Dumb, emit events, no business logic
- Containers (containers/): Smart, inject domain services ONLY

### Repository Pattern - CRITICAL
**Containers MUST inject domain services, NOT API services**

❌ Wrong: `private productsApi = inject(ProductsApi)`
✅ Correct: `private productService = inject(Products)`

### Service Injection Rules
- Presenters: UI services only (FocusMonitor, AnimationBuilder)
- Containers: Domain services only (Products, Auth)
- API services: Called ONLY by domain services

### Before Completing Tasks
- Verify no containers inject API services
- Verify no presenters inject business services
- Verify all API calls go through domain services
- See ARCHITECTURE.md for examples
